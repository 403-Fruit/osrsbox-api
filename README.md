# osrsbox-api

An open, free, complete and up-to-date RESTful API for Old School RuneScape (OSRS) items, monsters and prayer data. This repository hosts the source code for the `osrsbox-api`, the RESTful API for the [`osrsbox-db` project](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db). The official `osrsbox-api` project is available from:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com](https://api.osrsbox.com)

## Using the osrsbox API

This section documents the API structure and provides some guidance on usage:

### API Endpoints

The API currently has a total of 5 API endpoints, which you can query and get data. The following list documents the endpoints and associated URL:

- Items: [https://api.osrsbox.com/items](https://api.osrsbox.com/items)
- Equipment: [https://api.osrsbox.com/equipment](https://api.osrsbox.com/equipment)
- Weapons: [https://api.osrsbox.com/weapons](https://api.osrsbox.com/weapons)
- Monsters: [https://api.osrsbox.com/monsters](https://api.osrsbox.com/monsters)
- Prayers: [https://api.osrsbox.com/prayers](https://api.osrsbox.com/prayers)

### Swagger UI

For those new to REST APIs, Swagger is a set of rules (a specification) for describing API structure. Have a read of [What is Swagger?](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/), if you are interested. The osrsbox API provides Swagger documentation, available from:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/api-docs](https://api.osrsbox.com/api-docs)

More interestingly, you can try out specific API endpoints using the Swagger UI, available from:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/swaggerui](https://api.osrsbox.com/swaggerui)

In this interface, you can _Try out_ different API endpoints. For example, try the following:

- Browse to: [https://api.osrsbox.com/swaggerui](https://api.osrsbox.com/swaggerui)
- Click on the _GET /items_ button, which will expand
- Click on the _Try it out_ button
- Click on the _Execute_ button
- Browse the _Response_ section and you will find:
    - A curl command, which documents your API request
     - A request URL, which documents the API URL used
     - A response body, which documents the data you got back from the API

In the Swagger UI, there is a _Models_ section at the bottom of the page. If you review this section you will see the different properties available for the different API endpoints.

### Example API URLs

I always like examples to help learn how projects or resources are used. This section documents some useful examples for the osrsbox API. The API is most useful when integrating with an application, for example, a web application. But you can also query the API and view the results in a web browser to see the raw data.

#### Access All OSRS Items

To access all items you can use the following URL:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/items](https://api.osrsbox.com/items)

If you were interested in monsters, just replace the `items` endpoint, with `monsters` (the same is true for `equipment`, `weapons` or `prayers`):

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/monsters](https://api.osrsbox.com/monsters)

This query will return the first 25 items, out of approximately 23,000 available items. From here you can continue the query using pagination. The returned JSON from the first query will have a `_links` key, with a nested `next` key and also a nested `last` key. Below is an example:

```
"_links": {
    "parent": {
        "title": "home",
        "href": "/"
    },
    "self": {
        "title": "items",
        "href": "items"
    },
    "next": {
        "title": "next page",
        "href": "items?page=2"
    },
    "last": {
        "title": "last page",
        "href": "items?page=897"
    }
},
```

You can see that the next page is accessible using the `?page=2` parameter and there are pages available up to `?page=897`. You could make a loop to query all the pages from page 2 to page 897. A full URL example to fetch the second page would be:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/items?page=2](https://api.osrsbox.com/items?page=2)

#### Access a Specific OSRS Item

There are multiple ways to access a specific OSRS item (weapon, equipment, monster or prayer). Firstly, you can query a specific API endpoint and include the ID number. For example, to access the _Abyssal whip_ you could use the ID number `4151`, and use the following URL:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/items/4151](https://api.osrsbox.com/items/4151)

If you want to know a specific item or monster URL, you could use the following tools:

- [https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/item-search/](https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/item-search/)
- [https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/npc-search/](https://www.osrsbox.com/tools/npc-search/)

The second method to find a specific item would be to write a query for the API. Take the following example of finding the _Abyssal whip_ item. The following query would find any item by matching the item name:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/items?where={"name":"Abyssal%20whip"}](https://api.osrsbox.com/items?where={"name":"Abyssal%20whip"})

A couple of notes about this:

- OSRS item names always start with a capital letter
- No other capital letters occur in any OSRS name
- The `%20` indicates a space character

When you run this query, you will get a response containing 5 items. In OSRS, there may be items that have multiple occurrences, as duplicate items might be used in quests, minigames or have some other use. You can add query parameters to find the item you desire. Some useful API query parameters include:

- `duplicate`: A boolean indicating if the item is a duplicate
- `equipable_by_player`: A boolean indicating if the item is equipable (so not a placeholder or noted item)
- `equipable_weapon`: A boolean indicating if the item is a weapon

Using these properties, you could entend the initial query. For example:

- [https://api.osrsbox.com/items?where={"name":"Abyssal%20whip","duplicate":false,"equipable_weapon":true}](https://api.osrsbox.com/items?where={"name":"Abyssal%20whip","duplicate":false,"equipable_weapon":true})

## Setup Instructions

You can set up your own local API using the following instructions. These instructions are for Ubuntu 18.04 and have not been tested on other environments. But they are pretty generic for a Docker with Docker Compose environment.

### Clone this Repository

Start by cloning this repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-api.git
```

### Configure Development Environment

This repository, and the Docker configuration, is specifically implemented to build on the `api.osrsbox.com` server. This means that certain configuration options have been made that are for the live (production) environment. The following file change is required to run the API locally in development mode:

- `docker-compose.yml`: On lines 75 and 76, there are two volumes that docker-compose will try and mount - either the `app.dev.conf` (development) or `app.conf` (production) configuration files. This repo specifies the `app.conf` file, with the other commented out. If running locally, just switch how they are commented (uncomment the dev conf file, and comment the prod conf file).

### Configue Accounts

This project uses a collection of environment variables, stored in the `.env` file. This includes some credentials (usernames, passwords), as well as configuration (ports, database name).

The credentials should be changed before building this project, even in a development environment - just to be safe! Below is the default contents of the `.env` file: 

```
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=ruser
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=rpasswd
MONGO_PORT=27017
DATABASE_NAME=osrsbox-db
PROJECT_USERNAME=puser
PROJECT_PASSWORD=ppasswd
ENVIRONMENT=prod
```

Make sure to change the username and password values.

### Install Docker

The following instructions are for setting up an Ubuntu 18.04 server with Docker. These are mainly documented here for my own reference, and are basically a copy of a Digital Ocean tutorial.

Install the required packages for Docker:

```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

Add Docker GPG key, then add the repository to APT sources lists:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
```

Update package repositories, and set Docker repo instead of default Ubuntu repo:

```
sudo apt update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

Install the Docker package:

```
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Add current user to `docker` group to allow a user to run Docker:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
```

Install the `docker-compose` tool. The version should be bumped in the future.

```
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Set executable permissions for the `docker-compose` tool:

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Run the Docker Environment

Make sure you are at the root of the `osrsbox-api` repository. Build the Docker container:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Load Data into the API

The data used to be loaded via the host system - which has just been changed. Now you should load the data via the `eve` container. The needed scripts are in the `eve/scripts` folder, and can easily be executed by running the script within the Docker container. To insert the data, use the following command:

```
docker exec -t osrsbox-api-eve python3 /scripts/mongo_insert_osrsbox.py
```

I usually keep the `osrsbox` package updated in this repo - so that new and updated data is loaded into the API. You can always manually update the `osrsbox` version by modifying the version in the `eve/requirements.txt` file. You could also use something like `pur` to auto update the package in the same file.

### Check API is Live

Use Firefox (or another browser) to browse to an endpoint to check the data was inserted:

```
0.0.0.0/items
```

Done.
